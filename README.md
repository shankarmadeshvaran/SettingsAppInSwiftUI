## Concepts
I have used swift views such as Forms,Sections,Toggle,Picker,Stack,NavigationLink and etc.I have also implemented ActivityIndicator(UIKit) into swiftUI using UIViewRepresentable.

## Implementation
I have put an [detailed article](https://medium.com/a-developer-in-making/recreating-settings-app-using-swiftui-concepts-e034d2a95ed1?source=friends_link&sk=86cd50090fe6ce729292ec13859d9fe7) about this settings app implementation in Medium.
